A file is sort of like a new paper!
It stores data which coders can put in.
This data includes strings, integers, floats, bolean logic, lists, dictionaries and more!
You can access these files or even create them using with open!

However... write is a function where you can change/append a file.
This can be dangerous due to the fact that you can hack somebodys code easily and access important information, which may include BANK DETAILS!
